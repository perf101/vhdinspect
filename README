same-sector:
  Given a disk, count the number of sectors in each subsequent disk that are
  the same at the same address.

same-content:
  Given a disk, count the number of sectors in each subsequent disk that have
  the same content.

identical-sectors:
  Count the number of sectors that are identical across several disks (same
  position and content).

static-info:
  Display allocated, deferred, leaf_allocated and overwritten statistics.

content-histogram:
  Takes two disks.  Prints a list of sector hashes in the second disk that
  match sectors in the first disk.  Prints out the number of times each hash
  occurs.

For the above tools, disks are specified by listing the files in a chain in
reverse order: child parent parent_of_parent ...
If multiple disks are to be given, a comma is used as a separator:
child1 parent1 , child2 parent2

parse:
  Given a disk and a trace, output the number of sectors read.

parsehelper:
  Used by parse to output which sectors in a disk are metadata.


traceboot:
  Given a VM name, clones the VM and starts it, tracing the disks until it has
  booted up.

runtest:
  Uses traceboot to several times to output the number of sectors read from
  the base and leaf images during bootup.
